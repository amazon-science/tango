## Towards Centering Transgender and Non-Binary Voices to Measure Biases in Open Language Generation (TANGO)

TANGO is a dataset that consists of two sets of prompts to evaluate gender non-affirmative language in open
language generation (OLG). The first set consists of 2,880 prompts to evaluate generated text for misgendering.
The second set consists of 1,532,160 prompts to test how models respond to various gender disclosure forms. Dataset
templates were gathered from [Nonbinary Wikipedia](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) and populated with various referent forms and pronouns.

## Statement of Intended Data Use
TANGO is intended to help assess the extent to which models reflect undesirable societal biases relating to the Transgender and Non-Binary (TGNB) community, with the goal of promoting fairness and inclusivity in model building and avoid the perpetuation of harm to the TGNB community. Please use this dataset responsibly and in ways that do not cause harm, including to members of the TGNB community. Specifically, please be mindful about any use of the dataset that may be perceived as verifying someone’s transness or “gender diverseness” or to mistreat or marginalize the TGNB community. After this dataset is released, individuals’ gender identity, name, or other self-representation may change. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments about this dataset or the related paper, including to help ensure that it remains current and accurate, we welcome your feedback and input via this [form](https://forms.gle/PDxgLE1wskX9NbTZ8).
